## 4 ways to help people in their careers

# ![10%](elastic.png)

### @emanuil_tolev

^ 1

^ Hello! My name is Emanuil. I work for Elastic, the open source search company. But today we talk about a different kind of search - the search for fulfilment and meaning at work and how to help others find it! This is only my opinion and can be wrong.

---

## Who here has been helped in their career development?

^ 2

^ Now .. raise your hand if you've been helped in your career with some structured help method, like coaching?
^ Okay, (
^ there's quite a few of you ||
^ there aren't very many of you, you've got work to do!
^ )
^ These methods can really power up your corner of the sector: learn them and teach them.

---

## Coaching

^ 3

^ Alright, let's start with coaching. To me it is *typically* shorter term and more task-based, like upgrading a skill. But, when learning something different to our existing skills, we can get stuck and experience fear or anxiety.

---

## Coaching

# ![350%](broken-window.jpg)

^ 4

^ If our current work approach was a house, coaching focusses on fixing one window, like these fear blockers. A coach is both an empathetic listener *and* holds you accountable to *your own* goals.

---

## Mentoring

^ 5

^ Mentoring is a more exploratory relationship. You build it and focus on trends and approaches to work. What goals are even right for you? What are your values? How do you feel about the work?

---

## Mentoring

### üìêüè†

^ 6

^ Most mentoring will build up the ability to think and reflect. As a mentor you can connect the other person with people who think similarly, *or differently*, as needed. If work approaches were houses, mentoring challenges the layout, and even where the walls are.

---

## Sponsorship

^ 7

^ A sponsor is someone who has enough clout in the organisation to influence decisions *others make* about *your* progress. A sponsor believes *in you*, in your skills, abilities, and *potential* enough to risk their credibility for you.

---

## Sponsorship

### ü§ù

^ 8

^ A sponsor prepares relevant decision makers to see you in your best light and points out hidden opportunities. Going back to houses, a sponsor helps upgrade the house, either with a loan of credibility or directly with people and materials.

---

## Career counselling

^ 9

^ I picked this name and am not sure about it. Career counselling is a less formal type of active listening. Drawing out the positive details from another person's professional story, showing them a good narrative about themselves.

---

### CV and cover letter reviews

### Donut Slackbot: donut.com
# ![100%](donut.png)

^ 10

^ CV and cover letter reviews are a subset of this. They're a skill and art of their own - dig into them! I must mention Donut, a Slackbot which pairs people up. You could use it to encourage career counselling in your org.

---

# ![120%](boxes.png)

^ 11

^ So far so good, we've taken a blank slate and put 4 methods - 4 boxes on there. Useful and you should dig into these and use them to help people. But now let's go a bit deeper and more abstract.

---

# ![70%](glitterforce.jpg)

^ 12

^ Does anybody recognise these young women?
^ Glitter Breeze, Glitter Peace, Glitter Lucky, Glitter Sunny, Glitter Spring
^ Together they are the Glitterforce! This is a kids' show in which monsters try to give the story of the world a sad ending.

---

# ![90%](blackink.png)

^ 13

^ To do this they use magic black ink. When they arrive, everyone gets depressed and gives up on life. The Glitterforce beats the monsters by finding it within themselves to keep going and never give up, literally giving the world a happy ending.

---

## The power of stories and self-narrative

^ 14

^ The stories we tell ourselves are very powerful. They're not just make-believe, many become reality. Melancholy and contemplation *can* write self-imposed limits into people's internal narratives.

---

## Melancholy & contemplation are good

^ 15

^ Now, they are not bad. Sometimes you need focus to achieve things, but it's useful to be able to step back, and tech likes its tunnel vision optimism too much. They help reflect on how we feel and how we impact the world with our work.

---

## Mechanisms of doubt
^ 16

^ The problem is, people use them to write negative self-stories that tell them why they can't, why they are less, why they shouldn't. Mental mechanisms of doubt which reinforce each other and compound their effects.

---

## You're a companion

# ![70%](companion.jpg)

^ 17

^ Your most important role as a helper is to counteract these mechanisms. Mentoring, coaching and so on differ in the details but are united by this. You're a companion, taking a walk with the other person through the landscape of their mind.

---

## People must make their own journey -
## you can't do it for them.

^ 18

^ People must make their own journey - you can't do it for them. But you can keep your eyes open for self-limiting beliefs, fear and doubt. Use other people and resources to help explore and dissolve the underlying fear.

---

### What can you do at this conf?
- Go to the open spaces later. Listen carefully.
- Offer your time and discretion
- Try to open up about your problems if you're comfortable

### And at work
- Learn more about these help skills
- Poke people to think about these topics and learn
- Give a talk about it ;)

^ 19

^ To get you started practically, here are some things you can do at this conf and at work. Broadly speaking, listen carefully, be vulnerable if you can and make others reflect on who they want to be and what they want to do.

---

## Thank you!
# Go help others

#### (just check if they want / need it first!)

^ 20

^ Now go help other people blaze their way to a happy ending! Just be very sure to check if they want your help first. Thank you for listening, and good luck.
