## 4 ways to help people in their careers

# ![10%](elastic.png)

### @emanuil_tolev

^ 1

^ Hello! My name is Emanuil. I work for Elastic, the open source search company. Today though, we're talking about a different kind of search - the search for fulfilment and meaning at work! This is just my view of things and can be incomplete or wrong.

## Who here has been helped in their career development?

^ 2

^ Who here has been helped in their career development with some kind of structured help method, like coaching? Raise your hands.
^ Okay, (
^ there's quite a few of you, this is an important set of skills ||
^ there aren't very many of you, you've got work to do!
^ )
^ They're worthwhile methods which can really power up your corner of the sector.

---

## Coaching

^ 3

^ Coaching is a task-based type of help, *typically* shorter term. The person being coached has a specific goal, upgrading their skills to meet more responsibility, or because they feel they're behind. When learning something very different to their existing skills, people often get stuck and experience fear or anxiety.

## Coaching

^ 4

^ Coaching is supposed to help them get through these blockers more quickly than on their own. When you're coaching, you'll need to be an empathetic listener *and* hold the other person accountable to their own goals. If we think of their current work approach as a house, coaching focusses on fixing one window.

---

## Mentoring

^ 5

^ Mentoring is more exploratory. You build a relationship and focus on trends and approaches to work. For example what goals are right for that person? What are their values? How do they feel about work? Or how do they build an approach for achieving these goals.

---

## Mentoring

### üìêüè†

^ 6

^ Most mentoring will build up the ability to think and reflect. As a mentor you can connect the other person with people who think similarly, *or differently*, as needed. If work approaches were houses, mentoring challenges the layout, and even where the walls are.

---

## Sponsorship

^ 7

^ A sponsor is someone who has enough clout in the organisation to make a difference in decisions *others make* about *the sponsored person's* progress. A sponsor believes *in the person*, in their skills, and their abilities, enough to risk their own credibility for them.

---

## Sponsorship

### ü§ù

^ 8

^ A sponsor sets up 1:1s with relevant decision makers. They prepare those people to see the other person in their best light and point out hidden opportunities. Going back to houses, a sponsor helps upgrade the house, either with a loan of credibility or directly with people and materials.

---

## Career counselling

^ 9

^ I'm not sure about the name, but compared to the other methods career counselling is a less formalised type of active listening. Drawing out the positive details from another person's professional story, showing them a good narrative. Talking them up to risks they can take but are afraid of.

---

### CV and cover letter reviews

### Donut Slackbot: donut.com
# ![100%](donut.png)

^ 10

^ CV and cover letter reviews are a subset of this. They're a skill and art of their own - dig into them! I must mention Donut, a Slackbot. It's a fun low-key way to introduce people to each other and facilitate informal active career listening across your org.

---

# ![120%](boxes.png)

^ 11

^ So far so good, we've taken a blank slate and put four boxes on there. Useful and you should dig into these and use them to help people. But there's more to this. Let's go a bit deeper and more abstract.

---

# ![70%](glitterforce.jpg)

^ 12

^ Does anybody recognise these young women?
^ Glitter Breeze, Glitter Peace, Glitter Lucky, Glitter Sunny, Glitter Spring
^ Together they are the Glitterforce! This is a kids' show in which monsters try to give the story of the world a sad ending.

---

# ![90%](blackink.png)

^ 13

^ Notice the black ink splashed on a book. When the monsters arrive, everyone gets depressed and gives up on life. The Glitterforce beats the monsters by finding it within themselves to keep going and never give up.

---

## Melancholy & contemplation are good

^ 14

^ Our world, and especially tech, is often driven by narrow tunnel vision. Sometimes you need focus to achieve things, but it's useful to be able to step back. Back beyond mere "strategic perspective", into true reflection mode on how we feel and impact the world.

---

## The power of stories and self-narrative

^ 15

^ The stories we tell ourselves are very powerful. They're not just make-believe, many many stories become reality or affect it strongly in some way. Melancholy and contemplation can make people's internal narratives start to include self-imposed limits coming from fears and anxieties.

---

## Mechanisms of darkness
^ 16

^ As time passes, people affirm these negative self-stories, building elaborate mechanisms that tell them why they can't, why they are less, why they shouldn't. Mental mechanisms of darkness.

---

## You're a companion

# ![70%](companion.jpg)

^ 17

^ While the mentoring, coaching and so on differ in their everyday meaning and motions, they are united by the role you play. You're a companion, taking a walk with the other person through the landscape of their mind.

---

## People must make their own journey -
## you can't do it for them.

^ 18

^ People must make their own journey - you can't do it for them. But you can keep your eyes open for self-limiting beliefs and fears. You can point those out and refer them to resources or other people that can help them explore and eventually dissolve the underlying fear.

---

### What can you do at this conf?
- Go to the open spaces later. Listen carefully.
- Offer your time and discretion
- Try to open up about your problems if you're comfortable

### And at work
- Learn more about these help skills
- Poke people to think about these topics and learn
- Give a talk about it ;)
